Data directory
==============

This directory contains data files included with the package source
code distribution that was generated by running
:func:`skysim.scripts.prepare_data.main` via the ``skysim_prepare_data`` entry point.
You should not normally need to run this script yourself.

Use :func:`skysim.utils.data.get` to load data from this directory.

atmosphere.fits
---------------

This 3.1Mb FITS file was generated by :func:`skysim.scripts.prepare_atmosphere` and
tabulates zenith transmission curves and extinction-corrected airglow emission spectra
on a 0.01nm grid covering 300-1100nm.

solarspec.fits
--------------

This 11Kb file was generated by :func:`skysim.scripts.prepare_solarspec` and
tabulates the solar flux above the atmosphere on a 1-2nm grid covering 300-1100nm.

solarflux.ecsv
--------------

This 6Kb text file was generated by hand from the table at
http://www.spaceweather.ca/solarflux/sx-5-mavg-en.php and contains monthly average
observed solar flux at 10.7cm starting in 1986. Fluxes are observed (not adjusted), so
include variations to both solar activity and the earth-sun distance, in units
of sfu = 1e-22 W / (Hz m2).
